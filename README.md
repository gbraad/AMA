Ask me anything!
================


## [Ask a question](../../issues/new)
## [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)


Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.


Guidelines
----------

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
